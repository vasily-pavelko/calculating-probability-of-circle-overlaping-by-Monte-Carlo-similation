#To calculate probability of monoclonality we generate N colonies with center in (x,y) and raduis r. 
Radius of colonies has a distribution determined from ClonePix FL statistics.
Generate N colonies and each of them with each of rest. In diagonal line false poitive overlapping needs to be discounted.
Sum of matrix equal the number of overlaped colonies. Normed on number colonies is a  probability.
